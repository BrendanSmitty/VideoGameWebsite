				<h1>Random Gaming Fact!</h1>
				<div><b>Fact No.2: E.T the Extraterrestrial by Atari was the Worst Game Ever</b></div>
				<p>
					In 1982, Atari made a huge mistake by releasing an entry titled E.T the Extraterrestrial. The game was so bad that it's widely considered the worst video game 
					of all time. Urban legend has it that the company had to bury unsold copies of the game in the desert. This "myth" turned out to be true when a documentary 
					crew dug them up. But that's a whole other story.
